Peer's repository: https://github.com/peyloading/05-space-shooter-1.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
There is a lot more that I could have added instead of how simple mine was. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would like to add screen bounds. I didn't have that in my game. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I think that it was very explicit and clear! I wouldn't change anything!
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Nothing, there were a lot of comments that explain everything that he was doing. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The movement and game logic stuff didn't make any sense to me, but maybe I just havent experimented with it enough.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
More about the game, I also got an error message whenever I tried to play the game,
    "& : The term 'C:/Users/narni/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37-3
2/python.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, 
script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or 
if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try 
again.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, but maybe if there was something I needed to download it would have been nice to have
it in the readme. If its just my personal incompetence I'm sorry! 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
It's very indepth and much more complex than anything I came up with! Good job with the comments and going above and beyond in the coding aspect of this assignment!
